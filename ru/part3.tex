\begin{itemize}
\item Вы набираете документ в формате \emph{обычного текста} с \cmd{командами},
  которые описывают его структуру и смысл.
\item Программа \texttt{latex} обрабатывает ваш текст и команды и преобразовывает
  его в красиво отформатированный документ.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Команды и аргументы}
\begin{itemize}
\item Команды начинаются с \emph{обратной косой} \keystrokebftt{\bs}.
\item Некоторые команды принимают \emph{аргументы} в фигурных скобках \keystrokebftt{\{}
\keystrokebftt{\}}.
\item Некоторые команды также принимают \emph{необязательные аргументы} в
  квадратных скобках \keystrokebftt{[} \keystrokebftt{]}.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Окружения}
\begin{itemize}
\item Команды \cmdbs{begin} и \cmdbs{end} применяются, чтобы создавать много
  разных окружений --- контекстов.

\item Окружения \bftt{itemize} и \bftt{enumerate} печатают списки.
\vskip 2ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
% ненумерованный список
\begin{itemize}
\item Печенье

\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2^k}
\end{equation}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\item Значки доллара \keystrokebftt{\$} применяются для математики в тексте.
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
% результат так себе:
Пусть a и b --- два разных
натуральных числа и пусть
c = a - b + 1.

% так намного лучше:
Пусть $a$ и $b$ --- два разных
натуральных числа и пусть
$c = a - b + 1$.
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\item Первый значок начинает формулу, второй заканчивает.\\
{\scriptsize Но можно было бы писать \bftt{\$...\$} как
\cmdbegin{math}\bftt{...}\cmdend{math}.}

\begin{itemize}
\item You can use \cmdbs{section}s to group your \bftt{frame}s, and
\bftt{beamer} will use them to create an automatic outline.
\item To generate an outline, use the \cmdbs{tableofcontents} command. Here's
one for this presentation. The \bftt{currentsection} option highlights the current section.

\section{Drawings with \protect\tikzname}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item \tikzname{} is a package for drawing figures in \LaTeX.
\item It defines a powerful drawing language inside \LaTeX{}. Short programs can
draw surprisingly complicated things.
\begin{figure}
\href{http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/rotated-triangle/}{%
  \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{rotated-triangle}}
\end{figure}
\item We'll start with simple things. To draw a line in \tikzname:
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw (0,0) -- (1,1); % a line
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Coordinates}
\begin{itemize}
\item The default coordinates are centimeters, with the usual sense: 
\begin{figure}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
\node[below left] at (0,0) {$(0,0)$};
\node[below right] at (3,0) {$(3,0)$};
\node[above right] at (3,3) {$(3,3)$};
\node[above left] at (0,3) {$(0,3)$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\item It helps to draw a grid when you are working with \tikzname:
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Lines}
\begin{itemize}
\item Arrow heads and line styles are specified as options to the \cmdbs{draw} command.
\item End each draw command with a \keystrokebftt{;} semicolon.
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (1,1);

\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
% axes:

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Nodes \& Labels}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use nodes to place text (and math) in \tikzname{} drawings.
\item You can also use nodes as coordinates --- useful for diagrams.
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
\node (h) at (0,0) {H};

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \cmdbs{todo} command from the \bftt{todonotes} package is great for
leaving notes to yourself and your collaborators.
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\todo{add results}
\todo[color=blue!20]{fix method}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\vskip 2ex
\item Pro Tip: define your own commands with \cmdbs{newcommand}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\scriptsize,frame=single]{latex}
\newcommand{\alice}[1]{\todo[color=green!40]{#1}}
\newcommand{\bob}[1]{\todo[color=purple!40]{#1}}
\end{minted}
